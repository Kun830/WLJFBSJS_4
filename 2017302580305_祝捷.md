**2 Problems**

**P7**

The  time elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object should be 2RTT0+RTT1+RTT2+......+RTTn as we need one RTT0 to set up tcp connection and another RTT0 to request and get the data. 



**P22**

F = 15 Gbits  to N peers

Server upload rate: 30Mbps

Peer Download rate: 2Mbps

Peer Upload rate: u

Minimum distribution time for each of the combinations of N and u for client-server distribution

| N\u      | 300Kbps | 700Kbps | 2Mbps   |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **10**   | 7680s   | 7680s   | 7680s   |
| **100**  | 51200s  | 51200s  | 51200s  |
| **1000** | 512000s | 512000s | 512000s |

Minimum distribution time for each of the combinations of N and u for P2P distribution

| N\u      | 300Kbps | 700Kbps | 2Mbps |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| **10**   | 7680s   | 7680s   | 7680s |
| **100**  | 25903s  | 15616s  | 7680s |
| **1000** | 47554s  | 21525s  | 7680s |

So when the number of peers increases, the time of CS model will increase linearly while the time of P2P will be much faster especially when the uploading rate for each peer is large.



**P23**

a)

As we know that 
$$
\frac {u_s} {N} \leq d_{min}
$$
So the upload speed is dominant in the transmitting model.

One possible distribution scheme that has a distribution time of 
$$
\frac {NF} {u_s}
$$
 could be that the server simultaneously transmits to N peers in the speed of 
$$
\frac {u_s} {N}
$$
b)

In this case, 
$$
\frac {u_s} {N} \geq d_{min}
$$
so it is the client download speed that determines the overall time.

One possible distribution scheme that has a distribution time of 
$$
\frac {F} {d_{min}}
$$
 could be that the server simultaneously transmits to N peers in the speed of 
$$
d_{min}
$$
c)

Bacause the largest overall transmitting speed is 
$$
Min\{ \frac {F} {d_{min}}, \frac {u_s} {N} \}
$$
as we know that the upload and download rates must coordinate in this model.

Therefore, the minimum distribution time is in general given by 
$$
Min \{\frac {F} {d_{min}}, \frac {NF} {u_s}\}
$$
