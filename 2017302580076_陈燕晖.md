**Problem 27**
a. N files, under the assumption that we do a one-to-one matching by pairing video versions with audio versions in a decreasing order of quality and rate.
b. 2N files.
**Problem 28**
a. If you run TCPClient first, then the client will attempt to make a TCP connection with a non-existent server process. A TCP connection will not be made.
b. UDPClient doesn't establish a TCP connection with the server. Thus, everything should work fine if you first run UDPClient, then run UDPServer, and then type some input into the keyboard.
c. If you use different port numbers, then the client will attempt to establish a TCP connection with the wrong process or a non-existent process. Errors will occur.
**Problem 29**
In the original program, UDPClient does not specify a port number when it creates the socket. In this case, the code lets the underlying operating system choose a port number. With the additional line, when UDPClient is executed, a UDP socket is created with port number 5432 .
UDPServer needs to know the client port number so that it can send packets back to the correct client socket. Glancing at UDPServer, we see that the client port number is not “hard-wired” into the server code; instead, UDPServer determines the client port number by unraveling the datagram it receives from the client. Thus UDP server will work with any client port number, including 5432. UDPServer therefore does not need to be modified.
*Before:*
Client socket = x (chosen by OS)
Server socket = 9876
*After:*
Client socket = 5432
